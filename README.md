## ✨ Quote of the Day ✨

> "Twilight' is such an amazing project, and I think it opened up doors for all of us cast members.;Kellan Lutz;amazing
2293;I finish so many books it's amazing. I'm also doing Rosetta Stone, learning some French.;Kellan Lutz;amazing
2294;I was blessed, because I come from a family where they knock you down before you float away. I have a lot of brothers who just make sure we have our feet on the ground, and my mom is a rock star. She is an amazing mother.;Kellan Lutz;amazing
2295;When we're on set, we kind of joke around, and when we're rehearsing, we change up the scenes and make each other laugh. We lighten up the mood. The blooper reel is going to be amazing on 'New Moon." — **Kellan Lutz**
